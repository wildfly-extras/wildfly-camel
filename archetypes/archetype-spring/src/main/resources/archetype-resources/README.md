WildFly Camel Spring XML Web Application
=============

This is a template Apache Camel Spring application for the WildFly Camel subsystem. 

This project is setup to allow you to create a Apache Camel Spring application, which can be deployed to an application
server running the WildFly Camel subsystem. An example Spring XML Camel Route has been created for you, together with an Arquillian
integration test.

Prerequisites
=============

* Minimum of Java 1.7
* Maven 3.2 or greater
* WildFly application server. Refer to the WildFly Camel compatibility matrix for more information.

Getting started
---------------

1. Install the WildFly Camel subsystem distribution on your application server

2. Configure a $JBOSS_HOME environment variable to point at your application server installation directory

3. Start the application server from the command line

For Linux:

    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-camel.xml

For Windows:

    %JBOSS_HOME%\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-camel.xml


Building the application
------------------------

To build the application do:

    mvn clean install


Run Arquillian Tests
--------------------
    
By default, tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian requires the use of a container.

If you already have a running application server, you can run integration tests with:

    mvn clean test -Parq-remote

Otherwise you can get Arquillian to start and stop the server for you (Note: you must have $JBOSS_HOME configured beforehand):

    mvn clean test -Parq-managed


Deploying the application
-------------------------

To deploy the application to a running application server do:

    mvn clean package wildfly:deploy

The server console should display lines like the following:

    (MSC service thread 1-16) Apache Camel (CamelContext: spring-context) is starting
    (MSC service thread 1-16) Camel context starting: spring-context
    (MSC service thread 1-6) Bound camel naming object: java:jboss/camel/context/spring-context
    (MSC service thread 1-16) Route: route4 started and consuming from: Endpoint[direct://start]
    (MSC service thread 1-16) Total 1 routes, of which 1 is started


Access the application
----------------------

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/your-context-root?name=Kermit


Undeploying the application
---------------------------

    mvn wildfly:undeploy
