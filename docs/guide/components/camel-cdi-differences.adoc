#### Camel CDI for EAR deployments on {wildfly-camel}

Camel CDI EAR deployments on {wildfly-camel} have some differences in class and resource loading behaviour, compared to standard WAR or JAR deployments.

{wildfly} bootstraps Weld using the EAR deployment ClassLoader. {wildfly} also mandates that only a single CDI extension is created and shared
by all EAR sub-deployments.

This results in the 'Auto-configured' CDI Camel Context using the EAR deployment ClassLoader to dynamically load classes and resources.
By default, this ClassLoader does not have access to resources within EAR sub-deployments.

For EAR deployments, it is recommended that usage of the 'Auto-configured' CDI Camel Context is avoided and that `RouteBuilder` classes are annotated with one of 
the Camel subsystem link:index.html#_enable_camel_subsystem[activation annotations]. Or that a `CamelContext` is created via the `@ImportResource` annotation or through CDI producer methods and fields. 
This helps {wildfly-camel} to determine the correct ClassLoader to use with Camel.
