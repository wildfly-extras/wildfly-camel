### Adding Components

Adding support for additional Camel Components is easy

[discrete]
#### Add your modules.xml definition

A modules.xml descriptor defines the class loading behavior for your component. It should be placed together with the component's jar in `modules/system/layers/fuse/org/apache/camel/component`. Module dependencies should be setup for direct compile time dependencies.

Here is an example for the camel-ftp component

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.apache.camel.component.ftp">
  <resources>
    <resource-root path="camel-ftp-2.14.0.jar" />
  </resources>
  <dependencies>
    <module name="com.jcraft.jsch" />
    <module name="javax.xml.bind.api" />
    <module name="org.apache.camel.core" />
    <module name="org.apache.commons.net" />
  </dependencies>
</module>

Please make sure you don't duplicate modules that are already available in WildFly and can be reused.

[discrete]
#### Add a reference to the component

To make this module visible by default to arbitrary JavaEE deployments add a reference to `modules/system/layers/fuse/org/apache/camel/component/main/module.xml`

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.3" name="org.apache.camel.component">
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <module name="org.apache.camel.component.ftp" export="true" services="export"/>
  </dependencies>
</module>
