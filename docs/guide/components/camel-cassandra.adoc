### camel-cassandra

The http://camel.apache.org/cassandra.html[cassandra,window=_blank] component is an open source
NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts on commodity hardware. Like Amazon's DynamoDB, Cassandra
has a peer-to-peer and master-less architecture to avoid single point of failure and garanty high availability.
Like Google's BigTable, Cassandra data is structured using column families which can be accessed through the
Thrift RPC API or a SQL-like API called CQL.
