### camel-undertow

The http://camel.apache.org/undertow.html[undertow,window=_blank] 
component provides HTTP-based endpoints for consuming and producing HTTP requests. That is, the http://undertow.io/[Undertow,window=_blank] component behaves as a simple Web server. Undertow can also be used as a http client which mean you can also use it with Camel as a producer.

The Undertow component integrates with the Undertow server provided by {wildfly}.
