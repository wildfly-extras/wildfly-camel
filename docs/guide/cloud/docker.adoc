### Docker

This chapter gets you started on WildFly-Camel on https://www.docker.com/[Docker,window=_blank]  

#### Installing Docker

SSH into your instance and type 

```
$ sudo yum install -y docker
$ sudo service docker start
``` 

to install and start Docker.

##### Giving non-root access

The docker daemon always runs as the root user, and the docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root, and so, by default, you can access it with sudo.

If you have a Unix group called `docker` and add users to it, then the docker daemon will make the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the `docker` group when the daemon starts. The docker daemon must always run as the root user, but if you run the docker client as a user in the `docker` group then you don't need to add sudo to all the client commands.

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
$ sudo service docker restart
``` 

[TIP]
====
You may have to logout/login for this change to take effect

In my case I also had to add a host mapping like this

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-233 ~]$ sudo cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain
172.30.0.233	ip-172-30-0-233
```

and make the docker daemon bind to a number of sockets

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-217 ~]$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker
# Additional startup options for the Docker daemon
OPTIONS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
```

#### Running WildFly-Camel

With every WildFly-Camel release we also publish the latest https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wildflyext/wildfly-camel/[wildflyext/wildfly-camel,window=_blank] image.

You can run the standalone container like this

```
$ docker run --rm -ti -e WILDFLY_MANAGEMENT_USER=admin -e WILDFLY_MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD=admin -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 wildflyext/wildfly-camel
```

and access the admin console like this: http://54.154.82.232:9990/console
