### Source To Image

WildFly-Camel provides a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-To-Image,window=_blank]
(S2I) https://hub.docker.com/r/wildflyext/s2i-wildfly-camel/[Docker image,window=_blank] which enables you to build reproducable images from source.

#### Example S2I build

First you'll need to download and install the S2I tooling from https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[here,window=_blank].

Then you can build and run a Docker image from source. For example, to build the WildFly-Camel CDI quickstart:

```
$ s2i build https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel-examples.git -r 4.4.0 --context-dir camel-cdi wildflyext/s2i-wildfly-camel:4.4.0 wildfly-camel-example-cdi

$ docker run -p 8080:8080 wildfly-camel-example-cdi
```

#### S2I with OpenShift Origin

For convenience, WildFly-Camel provides an OpenShift https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/master/docs/guide/sources/wildfly-camel-imagestreams.json[ImageStream,window=_blank] 
template and an https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/master/docs/guide/sources/wildfly-camel-template.json[application template,window=_blank] which enable you to to perform S2I build and deployments in OpenShift origin.

First add the WildFly-Camel S2I ImageStream.
```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/master/docs/guide/sources/wildfly-camel-image-streams.json
```

Then add the application template.
```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/master/docs/guide/sources/wildfly-camel-template.json
```

When you select 'Add to Project' in the OpenShift web console you should see a new catalog item named
's2i-wildfly-camel'. Choose this option, provide the required template parameters and click 'Create' to start the build process.

You'll then be able to monitor your application S2I build and deployment in OpenShift. Eventually you should see your application with 1 pod running.
