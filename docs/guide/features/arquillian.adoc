### Arquillian Test Support

The {wildfly-camel} test suite uses the WildFly http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian,window=_blank] managed container. This can connect to an already running {wildfly} instance or alternatively start up a standalone server instance when needed.

A number of test enrichers have been implemented that allow you to have these {wildfly-camel} specific types injected into your Arquillian test cases.
