### Camel Context Deployments

You can deploy camel contexts to {wildfly} with a **-camel-context.xml** suffix as:

* a standalone XML file
* a part of another supported deployment

A deployment may contain multiple **-camel-context.xml** files.

A deployed Camel context is CDI injectable like this

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
@Resource(lookup = "java:jboss/camel/context/mycontext")
CamelContext camelContext;
