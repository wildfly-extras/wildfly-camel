Beware: If you want to expect that 0 messages then take extra care as 0 matches when the tests starts so you need to set a assert period time to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for that use link setAssertPeriod(long). An alternative is to use NotifyBuilder and use the notifier to know when Camel is done routing some messages before you call the link assertIsSatisfied() method on the mocks. This allows you to not use a fixed assert period to speedup testing times. If you want to assert that exactly n'th message arrives to this mock endpoint then see also the link setAssertPeriod(long) method for further details." },
